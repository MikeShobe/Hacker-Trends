Having a significant Windows background, I am trying to get a feel for a general "Linux workflow" some programmers use.<p>I alreasy looked at NetBeans, CodeBlock, Anjuta as far as IDEs are concerned, but strangely enough I liked vim-based code editing the most. Autotools is going to be an issue, but we\'ll learn it.<p>But how do you guys deal with help/documentation, for instance? None of the IDEs had any kind of integrated help either. Basically I am interested in well-accepted more-or-less common workflows that C/C++ coders on Linux typically follow. My distro is full of C or C++ libraries, often with doc-packages (man or info files) that I\'d want to reference while coding. How do people do that? After 8 years of MSDN library it doesn\'t feel too good...<p>Thank you.',
