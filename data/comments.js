On one hand its just overlaying a template on an image, but its using and manipulating a scene graph for the various parts of the template. The templates are defined by the relationship of various landmarks - these relationships (like the angles and distances between certain points) are represented in my own language so that I can send them to client for evaluation (as they move parts of the template) or to R so that I can generate a set of landmark locations that fit the relationships.<p>I probably make things more complicated than they need to be but I can\'t imagine not understanding these concepts.

But, in Silicon Valley, $15 an hour is well below the poverty line.  I\'m sure that works its way up the economic ladder as well.  If a moving company owner can make $60-100k a year, in many parts of the country, that\'s considered rather wealthy.  In Silicon Valley, that would probably be a lower middle class income.<p>Where my in-laws live, in Toledo, Ohio, there are <i>tons</i> of talented artists and musicians.  But while there is a great supply, and no demand from wealthy music lovers to support them.  So, while a relative plays in a Jazz band every weekend and packs out the club, he has to keep his day job as a small engine mechanic.  The clubs just don\'t pay enough.  It\'s not that people don\'t like his music.  It\'s that there is no money in that part of the country for skills.  It\'s a lot harder to pay musicians when you\'re charging $2 for a beer instead of $8 for a mixed drink, or $120 for dinner and drinks for two at Yoshi\'s in San Francisco.<p>I\'m assuming that if he move to the Bay area, where there is a lot more demand for Jazz, he might be able to make a decent living by playing clubs.<p>Just my $.02',

    text: 'I should be finishing my degree this summer, and I knew going into the program that I wanted to be doing web startups when I was done.  So, I chose a program the focused more on Software Engineering than straight CS.<p>So, tailored my education along the lines of creating startups.  My classes the last 2 years have included Intro to Database systems, Unix programming, Perl, Web Database Programming, Advanced Database systems, Distributed Systems, and Systems Programming.  I\'ve avoided Java and Microsoft technologies whenever I\'ve been able to.<p>Every time that I get a semester break, I work on learning Django, or Ruby on Rails, and every semester web development comes a little easier to me.  I\'ve also been doggedly pursuing my own education, and I\'m not relying on my school to give it to me on a silver platter.  School is there to give you a framework, on which you continue your self-education.  So, when I was taking my Distributed systems class, I read up on Erlang, and the other students had no idea what that language was for.<p>There are people in my advanced database classes that are editing SQL with notepad on windows.  I was trying to tell them that a decent text-editor might improve their quality of life a little bit.  Several of them didn\'t know what the difference between notepad and a decent text editor was.  Sigh...  I guess that it goes to show that it\'s not the school, it\'s the student.',

Without eye-tracking, being just a little off  optimal position could ruin the effect.<p>With cheap eye-tracking, software can see which eye is in which zone, always maintaining the proper left-right mapping. (There might be flickering in transitions; I suspect people would adapt or software could fall back to monoscopic when eyes are misaligned. Thus you always have at least as strong an illusion of 3D as in this demo, but if your eyes fall into the proper lens bands -- boom! -- true stereo vision.)<p>¹ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_lens</a>',

Since, presumably, you don\'t want to have to babysit the thing yourself all the time forever, that means picking a handful of people and \'blessing\' them to do it for you.<p>So! Here\'s one way that might work -- though there\'re gonna be some objections to it:<p>Pick a dozen or twenty users that you think really \'get\' what you want the site to be about. Set a special flag on them in your database. When they upvote a submission, it counts for a little extra, say 1.5 points; likewise if they downvote a submission. Then, you need to make sure that as people come and go, you still have this active core group of people tuning your site for you. So, if an \'unblessed\' user gets habitually upmodded in their comments, or their submissions, by members of your blessed group, over a period of time that unblessed user gets automatically blessed, and their votes count for a little extra too.<p>This still leaves the door open for debates and arguments, while -- I think -- helping the site to stay on-subject without your active participation all the time.',
